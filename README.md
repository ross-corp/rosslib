# ROSSLIB

a better version of goodreads

recently I got an email that the "didn't finish shelf" is a feature "coming soon" to goodreads. this is a company with a hideous product and 428 employees. suck my nuts

## ROADMAP

Thigns ROSSLIB supports that Goodreads doesn't:

- Computed Collections
- more customizable UI
- better book pages with discussion threads, auto-grouped with embeddings / RAGlike
- better wiki-style links of relevant works, see above
- community submitted works (non-ISBN uploads)
- CLI
- calibre web integration
